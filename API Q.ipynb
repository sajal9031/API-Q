    "\n",
    "3. Security: REST provides security through HTTPS and SSL, while SOAP provides its own security layer through WS-Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexibility: RESTful APIs are more flexible and can work with a wider range of devices and platforms, while SOAP APIs are typically more rigid and can be more difficult to work with in some environments.\n",
